# Sequential Social Dilemmas

The games implemented as Prisoner's Dilemma, Chicken and Stag Hunt.

## The possible strategies to play with:

* **Policy-conditioned Beliefs**: SISC, pC, pA
* **Other strategies**: Tit for Tat, All C, Adversarial, Random

To play a game choose the game type and strategy in "play.py" to generate the data. Then choose the same parameters in "plot.py" to plot the cooperation (and epsilon if the strategy is SISC).
