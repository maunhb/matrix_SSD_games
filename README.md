# Sequential Social Dilemmas

## Games:

The games implemented are Prisoner's Dilemma, Chicken, and Stag Hunt.

## Available Strategies:

* **Policy-conditioned Beliefs**: ARCTIC, pC, pA
* **Other strategies**: Tit for Tat, All C, Adversarial, Random

## How to use:

To play a game choose the game type and strategy in "play.py" to generate the data. Then choose the same parameters in "plot.py" to plot the cooperation (and epsilon if the strategy is ARCTIC).

The X and Beta parameters will change how the ARCTIC and pC beliefs play. 


For more details on ARCTIC and policy-conditioned beliefs see https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10305.
